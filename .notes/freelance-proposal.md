# Proposal

Hello! My name is Kuanysh. I’m a full-stack developer which means I can design
and develop both user-facing interfaces as well as APIs. I’d used the buzzwords
tech like Serverless, GraphQL. Basically saying I’m all you need to build your
app and website in a fast and efficient manner, both as a sole provider and a
team member.

Given your description on a front-end developer position I’m confident to say
that I’ll be able to fulfill the requirements needed to move the needle
forward, be it a front-end or a back-end.

I’m available for contract work and ready to get started as soon as possible.
I’m at GMT+6 so close enough to be in sync with European team. My rate is $89/h
with a 10% discount if we exceed 20 hours a week.

My GitHub is https://github.com/kuka.

What would be a good time for a call? My contacts are tel: +7-775-602-64-67
(Telegram or a cell), skype: kuka_io.

Looking forward to your reply. Thanks!

Hey Phillip,

I’m a full-stack developer with a focus on web apps built with node, React and the whole JS eco-system. I’m fully capable of designing and building out the needed functionality from the ground up from
abstract ideas on paper to mockups to concise maintainable code for front-end and its APIs. From 0 to 100.

Most recently I’ve used server-side rendered React/Redux/GraphQL deployed to serverless AWS Lambda.

I’ve been working in agile/startup environment as a remote consultant for several companies and agencies for the last few years.

For the last few months I’ve been thinking about sharing more of my knowledge and it feels like stars have aligned. I’m not sure what responsibilites this role brings but I’m sure I’ve got the needed
expertise technology-wise.

Looking forward to hearing from you to discuss the needs and how I can bring my skills to the table.

Thanks!
