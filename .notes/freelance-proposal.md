# Proposal

Hello! My name is Kuanysh. I’m a full-stack developer which means I can design
and develop both user-facing interfaces as well as APIs. I’d used the buzzwords
tech like Serverless, GraphQL. Basically saying I’m all you need to build your
app and website in a fast and efficient manner, both as a sole provider and a
team member.

Given your description on a front-end developer position I’m confident to say
that I’ll be able to fulfill the requirements needed to move the needle
forward, be it a front-end or a back-end.

I’m available for contract work and ready to get started as soon as possible.
I’m at GMT+6 so close enough to be in sync with European team. My rate is $89/h
with a 10% discount if we exceed 20 hours a week.

My GitHub is https://github.com/kuka.

What would be a good time for a call? My contacts are tel: +7-775-602-64-67
(Telegram or a cell), skype: kuka_io.

Looking forward to your reply. Thanks!
