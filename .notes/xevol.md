# Xevol Interfaces · Manifesto

## Goals

1. To become *the app* every time someone wants to purchase or schedule
products, tickets, events or services.

2. To attract people into buying online who have never purchased online before
through a concise interface with clean language.

3. To become *the app* vendors, wholesale suppliers and service providers *want
to* use when it comes to marketing. This must include those who’ve never had
online shop as well.

4. To be the place people go to “shop”. To achieve that we must focus on
personalization as consumers must come not only to purchase one thing they
already have in mind, but to experience “shopping” and like items they’ve never
thought they’d like.

5. To attract those providers who are selling on other platform (Instagram,
Craigslist, OLX) to finalize the transaction on the platform instead of
phone-calling or chatting.

6. To handle all the transaction complexity between providers and customers
including logistics and payment.
