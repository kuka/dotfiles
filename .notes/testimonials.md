“Kuanysh was a great asset to the team. It’s rare to find someone who can
independently solve problems, communicate them clearly, and think ahead instead
of just on the current problem. Kuka would make a great addition to any team
and is very dependable when it comes to timing and cost expectations!”
- Austin Kettner, co-founder at Wonderkiln LLC

“Kuanysh helped us in implementing UI for one of the biggest clients and I can
confirm his professionalism as any problem we’ve had was solved efficiently in
a short timespan and delivered to production without hiccups. He impressed us
with his work and saved us time”
— Eldar Zakiryanov, CTO at Metaphor
